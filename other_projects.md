# Other Projects

On this page, you will find links to some other projects that I have worked on, that are not directly related or solely applied to astrophysics, but which I still find interesting enough to share here!


### [Fractals](https://hematthi.github.io/other_projects/fractals.html)

Fractals are infinitely beautiful but can arise from seemingly simple math. They are easy to simulate too! I show how you can uncover an incredible amount of detail from a few lines of code, using the Mandelbrot set as an example...

### [Gaussian Processes](https://hematthi.github.io/other_projects/gaussian_processes.html)

What are Gaussian processes (GP's) and how do they work? I provide a simple introduction to GP regression and explain how I use them in my research...

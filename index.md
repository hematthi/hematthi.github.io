# About Me

## Hello!

I'm Matthias and I do research in astrophysics! I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Notre Dame (in the Department of Physics and Astronomy)](https://physics.nd.edu).
Recently, I received my PhD in Astronomy & Astrophysics (with a [graduate minor in Computational Science](http://www.csci.psu.edu)) from [Penn State](https://science.psu.edu/astro) in 2022. Prior to starting my PhD in 2016, I went to the University of Toronto for my undergraduate degree where I graduated with high distinction. I am a Canadian citizen.

I am broadly interested in the field of exoplanets. My primary research focus is on exoplanet population synthesis and characterization. I use computational and statistical methods to study the detection, system architectures, dynamics, and formation of exoplanets. Although my graduate-level research deals exclusively with exoplanets, I have also dabbled in other (closely and not-so-closely) related topics in astrophysics including N-body simulations of triple stellar systems, as well as variable stars and astrophysical transients. In fact, each of my research projects started during my undergraduate studies has led to a journal publication â€“ you can read more about them (including the papers themselves, if you are really interested) in the [Research](https://hematthi.github.io/research.html) and [Publications/CV](https://hematthi.github.io/publications_cv.html) tabs!

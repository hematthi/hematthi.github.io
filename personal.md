## Photos of memorable trips

### [Iceland](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/iceland.html)

In the summer of 2019, I had the wonderful opportunity to spend over a week in Iceland for the [Extreme Solar Systems IV](https://sites.northwestern.edu/iceland2019/) conference, where I gave a talk in front of over 600 leading astronomers and astrophysicists, the largest audience I've experienced! Here I provide an album of my photos from this trip.

To start the new year of 2020, I spent a week in Honolulu, Hawaii to give a talk at the [ExoPAG 21 meeting](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/events/292/exopag-21/) and attend the [AAS 235](https://aas.org/meetings/aas235) conference. Here are some photos from this trip!

### [Drawings](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/drawings.html)

Drawing was a childhood hobby of mine. I show a few of my drawings (graphite and coloured pencils) that I am proud of. I hope that I can expand my collection in the future...

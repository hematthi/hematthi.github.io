## Photos of memorable trips

### [Iceland](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/iceland.html)

In the summer of 2019, I had the wonderful opportunity to spend over a week in Iceland for the [Extreme Solar Systems IV](https://sites.northwestern.edu/iceland2019/) conference, where I gave a talk in front of over 600 leading astronomers and astrophysicists, the largest audience I've experienced! Here I provide an album of my photos from this trip.

### [Hawaii (Jan 2020)](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/hawaii_2020-01.html)

To start the new year of 2020, I spent a week in Honolulu, Hawaii to give a talk at the [ExoPAG 21 meeting](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/events/292/exopag-21/) and attend the [AAS 235](https://aas.org/meetings/aas235) conference. Here are some photos from this trip!

### [Hawaii (Dec 2022)](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/hawaii_2022-12.html)

I had the opportunity to revisit Hawaii near the end of 2022 for a combined vacation and work (observing on Keck) trip! This time, my family also joined me (for their first time in Hawaii), and we got to visit many more places, including the big island!

### [Drawings](https://hematthi.github.io/personal/drawings.html)

Drawing was a childhood hobby of mine. I show a few of my drawings (graphite and coloured pencils) that I am proud of. I hope that I can expand my collection in the future...
